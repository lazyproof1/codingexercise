# Todo List

Todo Application made for Android OS with a slight touch of [Material Design](https://material.google.com/).

## How to use

A little tour about the application's functionalities:

#### Add

User may add multi-line tasks in the input text located at the bottom of the screen.

#### List

*Looks like a list, feels like a list and functions like a list!* 

#### Delete

User can select any tasks and delete them from the *action menu bar* located on at the top right corner.

#### Update

After adding or deleting a task, the todo list will update itself.

#### Others

Some additionnal functionalities exist despite not being part of the main objective. They were mostly made for experience and fun:

* **Saved tasks**: upon leaving or closing the app, tasks data will still remain.
* **Copy to clipboard** by long clicking: tasks can be pretty useful for saving, copying and sending information. *Deleting 5 tasks by long pressing items is pretty harsh.*

## Built with

* Backend: Java
* Frontend: Android
